//Walter 's tip of the day: 10/14/2020

//Did you know you can set custom images for Scripts and GameObjects?
//https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AssigningIcons.html

//For scripts: Select the script in the Project Window and click on the current icon in the Inspector Window.
//You can now use one of Unity's presets or use your own icon by selecting "Other"


//This is especially useful for things that are invisible, like spawnpoints.
//Unity themselves uses it for AudioSources and Cameras because those are invisible too.
//Fits right in.
